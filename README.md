### Business Introduction
The urban transportation and road safety sector plays a vital role in safeguarding lives, reducing congestion, and ensuring sustainable mobility. In densely populated cities like New York City, traffic collisions remain a critical public safety concern, impacting residents, emergency services, and city infrastructure.

### Business Problem
Despite advances in traffic management and safety policies, NYC still recorded over 238,421 accidents, resulting in 1,236 fatalities. A closer look is needed to answer:
What factors are driving these accidents, where and when do they occur most frequently, and what actionable steps can reduce their frequency and severity?

### Objectives of The Analysis
The objective of this analysis is to:
-	Track the volume and fatality rates of traffic accidents in NYC over time.
-	Analyze accident causes, vehicle types involved, and geographic concentration by borough and street.
-	Identify time-based patterns to help inform policy decisions, enforcement strategies, and safety improvements.

### Data Transformation and Analysis
To deliver clear insights, the following steps were taken:
1.	**Data Aggregation and Cleaning:**
- Combined multi-year traffic data (2021–2023) from city crash reports.
-	Removed duplicates Sand categorized missing or ambiguous values (e.g., "Unspecified" contributing factors and unknown vehicle types).
-	Filled down in a few empty rows.

2.	**Categorical Grouping:**
-	Vehicle types, streets, and accident causes were grouped and summarized to assess impact by segment.
-	Fatalities were broken down by vehicle category to highlight which modes of transport contribute most to loss of life.

3.	**Time Series & Heatmap Visualization:**
-	Used time-series line charts to display accident trends by month.
-	Developed a weekday-hour heatmap to uncover daily traffic risk periods.
-	Created bar charts to highlight top contributing factors and geographic hot spots.

### Insights
-	Driver Inattention/Distraction is the leading contributing factor (58,308 cases), tied closely with "Unspecified" causes.
-	Passenger vehicles are involved in the majority of fatal collisions (806 deaths), followed by motorcycles (124).
-	Brooklyn (32%) and Queens (27%) account for over half of all accidents, signaling potential infrastructure or enforcement gaps.
-	Accidents peak during afternoon and evening hours, particularly 3–6 PM, across all days—with Sunday and Saturday showing elevated incident counts, especially after midday.

### Recommendations
1.	Target Behavioral Causes:
Increase public awareness and enforcement around distracted driving and failure to yield right-of-way, which combined account for over 30% of incidents.
2.	Geographic Focus:
Allocate more resources (e.g., patrols, traffic calming interventions) to Brooklyn and Queens, as these boroughs exhibit the highest frequency of collisions.
3.	Time-Based Interventions:
Adjust enforcement schedules and traffic signal timing during peak accident hours (especially between 3 PM and 6 PM on weekends) to reduce collision risk.
4.	Vehicle-Specific Safety Campaigns:
Introduce targeted campaigns for passenger vehicle and motorcycle safety, given their higher fatality contributions.
